MultiRegion - A cache efficient solver for max-flow/min-cut problems on grid graphs.

Currently it only supports 4-connected 2D-grids but it will be developed to support a variety of neighborhoods.

The goal is to make it run on grids that are complete along the last dimension, allowing quick multi region segmentations using a single graph cut. The technique is described in the article "Globally Optimal Segmentationof Multi Region Objects" by A.Delong and Y.Boykov, http://www.psi.toronto.edu/~andrew/ .

Right now there are some small examples using the MRGraph class to find minimum cuts on 2D grids.

Example 3 requires the GridCut headers that can be downloaded from www.gridcut.com .
