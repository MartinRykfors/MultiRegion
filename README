MultiRegion - A cache efficient solver for max-flow/min-cut problems on grid graphs.

Its purpose is to solve max-flow problems on flat 3D grids that are complete along the last dimension. This allows for more complicated image segmentations using a single graph cut. For inctance, it allows splitting an image into three segments (two objects and background) optimally. The technique is described in the article "Globally Optimal Segmentation of Multi Region Objects" by A.Delong and Y.Boykov, http://www.psi.toronto.edu/~andrew/ .

It implements a slightly modified version of the algorithm by A. Golberg et al. research.microsoft.com/pubs/150437/ibfs-proc.pdf .

Currently there are a variety of small examples showing how the MRGraph class is used.

Example 3 and the benchmark requires the GridCut headers that can be downloaded from www.gridcut.com .

Currently it lacks support for 8-connected 2D grids as well as 6- and 26 connected 3D grids. A file format for problem instances, similar to the DIMACS format is being developed, as well as a parser for such files.
